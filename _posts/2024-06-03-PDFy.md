# PDFy

## Basic Enumeration
Upon starting the docker instance, I was given a link to the PDFy website. It appeared to be an HTML to PDF converter where you supply a webpage and it will take a snapshot of the page and convert it as a PDF and relay it back to you. I tested it by putting 'https://google.com' in the textbox and seeing what happened. ![Home Page](PDFy/Screenshot_20240603_083433.png)

## Looking for Exploits
To determine if an exploit is possible, we should check to see what software is being used to convert the website into a PDF. As this is some kind of a web scraper, the user-agent might tell us what version of the software is running. Starting a netcat listener on a port like 8000 and then creating an ngrok tunnel to that port will allow us to see the request that is made.

The user-agent reports that the software being used is "wkhtmltopdf" and looking this up on Google shows that it may be vulnerable to SSRF and LFI exploits.

## Exploitation
Reading through some of these posts shows that running a simple PHP payload to redirect the PDF generator to file:///etc/passwd would work. The payload I used was found [here](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/web/security-risk/wkhtmltopdf-ssrf/) but I swapped out the variable for just /etc/passwd. Then, I dumped that into a file called test.php and spun up a PHP web server using 'php -S 0.0.0.0:8000'. Now entering 'http://$ngrok_ip:port/test.php' into the text box and clicking submit returned the contents of /etc/passwd and leaked the flag.
